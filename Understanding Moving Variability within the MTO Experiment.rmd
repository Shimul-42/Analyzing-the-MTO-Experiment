#Part 1
#Estimating an OLS regression of working on whether someone moved using an MTO voucher.
#We will interpret any found moving effects, and see if we can interpret our results as causal effects.

MtoRegress <- lm(working_end ~ moved_using_voucher_end, data = mto)

summary(MtoRegress)

#Holding all variables constant, the average probability of someone being on the
#working end is 0.46100 probability points, which is statistically significant
#at the 0.05 level. Moreover, the probability of working increases by 0.15115
#percentage points if the person moved using vouchers, which is a statistically
#significant finding at every reasonable level (or, here, at the 0.05 level).

#We now take this a step further by including an indicator variable for high school graduation as a control variable.
#We will now interpret our moving effect, and see whether we can look for any omitted variable bias seen in the above.

MtoRegressHS <- lm(working_end ~ moved_using_voucher_end + high_school_grad_start, data = mto)

summary(MtoRegressHS)

#Holding all variables constant, the average probability of someone being in the
#working end here is 0.22168 probability points, statistically significant at 
#the 0.05 level. The probability of working increases by 0.08064 percentage points 
#if the person moved using vouchers, and by another 0.70040 percentage points if
#the person had a high school graduation start, both findings being statistically
#significant at every reasonable level.

#The MTO experiment was a randomized experiment where families living in high poverty areas were randomly assigned to receive housing vouchers. We will use treated as our instrument. 
#This variable is equal to 1 for families that received a housing voucher through the experiment, and is 0 otherwise.

#The use of the variable 'treated' in this model is a sound and valid instrument 
#in terms of the independence assumption and the exclusion restriction, given that
#it violates neither of these requirements. This is due to the fact that it is
#simply an instrument of indication of which group was the control group and 
#which one the treated, having no effect on the *outcome* on its own. The instrument
#only has an effect on the exposure, not the outcome. Since this is simply an
#indicator, it also does not affect the value of that the observations in the two 
#groups have, that is, it does not cause the value of one observation to influence
#the value of the other observation.

#Let us check the estimated coefficient now, and estimate the first-stage regression here.

firstmto <- lm(moved_using_voucher_end ~ treated, data = mto)
summary(firstmto)

#Here, we can see that the estimated coefficient on the instrument variable
#results in an outcome statistically significant at the 1% level, and less than 
#the value of 1. This indicates that the instrument does satisfy the first-stage
#assumption. 
#The fact that the coefficient is found to be less than 1 simply indicates
#that not everyone that received a voucher decided to move. But what we can see 
#is that there is a positive relationship between moving and getting a voucher 
#to help move, that is, for every person given a voucher, the average
#probability of moving increased by  5.244e-01 percentage points, significant
#statistically at every reasonable level. This thereby further points to the 
#validity of the instrument used in our regression.

#Reduced form regression:

reducedmto <- lm(working_end ~ treated, data = mto)
summary(reducedmto)

ratioreport <- coef(reducedmto)["treated"]/coef(firstmto)["treated"]
print(ratioreport)

#The calculated ratio is: -0.01042101

#Verifying results using R command ivreg and AER package:
library(AER)

ivRegmto <- ivreg(working_end ~ moved_using_voucher_end | treated , data = mto)
summary(ivRegmto)

#This shows us the average effect of receiving vouchers on families that moved as
#a result, without looking into the baseline variables. This shows us that the 
#probability of families moving post receiving a voucher shows a decrease in 
#average by -0.01042 percentage points, which is not statistically significant
#at our chosen level. Without getting vouchers, the probability of moving was at 
#0.51624 percentage points, statistically significant at the 1% level, a probability 
#which decreases by -0.01042 percentage points when given vouchers.

#Including base 9 characteristics:

firstmtoALL <- lm(moved_using_voucher_end ~ treated + high_school_grad_start + male_respondant 
               + black_respondant + never_married_start + parent_before_18 + 
                 on_welfare_start + verydissat_neighborhood_start + 
                 victim_of_crime_start + want_move_gangs_drugs_start, data = mto)
summary(firstmtoALL)

#Using the set-up as before, we see here that when keeping all variables
#constant, the probability of moving without using vouchers was actually negative, 
#at -0.133358 probability points. However, on using the treatment, we see the 
#probability average of moving increase by 0.522178 percentage points, indicating
#a positive relationship between the treatment and outcome. Both these findings 
#are statistically significant at the 1% level. As for the other nine variables,
#we can see that having a high school graduation start has a negative impact on the
#probability of moving by -0.053600 percentage points, statistically significant 
#at the 5% level. The variable black_respondent shows that if the respondent was
#a black person, the probability of moving was increased by 0.047393 probability 
#points, significant at the 5% level. If the respondent was a parent before reaching
#the age of 18, the probability of moving was increased by 0.043900 percentage 
#points, statistically significant at the 10% level. If the respondent was 
#dissatisfied with the neighborhood to begin with,then the probability of them 
#moving was increased by 0.110258 percentage points, statistically significant at 
#every reasonable level.
#We can see that between these findings and the ones where we identified the first-stage regression, the 
#coefficient value actually increases here (0.522178) when compared to the previous
#finding, where we found without accounting for all the controls (5.244e-01). This 
#indicates that the coefficient outcome found before was more accurate/better 
#fitting and more concise a finding of the outcome than in this question. This 
#could be explained by the following possible reasons: using this many controls 
#actually could have ended up explaining some of the variation that was previously
#just explained by the treatment variable alone. Essentially, the nine control
#variables reduce the effect of the treatment on the outcome by adding too many
#other reasons for explaining the outcome than leaving it up to the treatment alone.
#This is an important finding given that if we had not controlled for these
#variables, we would have overestimated the effect of the treatment on the outcome,
#resulting in a biased estimation of the relationship between the treatment and outcome.

#Full IV model based on all 9 baseline characteristics:

ivRegmto2 <- ivreg(working_end ~ moved_using_voucher_end + male_respondant + 
                     high_school_grad_start + black_respondant + 
                     never_married_start + on_welfare_start + parent_before_18 +
                     victim_of_crime_start + verydissat_neighborhood_start + 
                     want_move_gangs_drugs_start| treated +
                     male_respondant + high_school_grad_start + black_respondant + 
                     never_married_start + on_welfare_start + parent_before_18 +

                     want_move_gangs_drugs_start, data = mto)
summary(ivRegmto2)

#Here, now correcting for all baseline variables, we can see that the coefficient 
#for moved_using_voucher_end actually increased to -0.01939 probability points 
#versus the previous -0.01042, also becoming more significant (although not at a 
#statistically significant level). As our coefficient gains significance, we see
#a decrease in standard error as well (0.02097) versus the previous 0.03504. This
#shows us that our model is much better fitting compared to the one in R command ivreg and AER, 
#indicating that using all baseline characteristics was helpful in providing us with
#a better fit and estimation. However, all this being said, we still do not have a 
#statistically significant coefficient outcome.
